                    <li>Pronouns: They/Them</li>
                    <li>Favorite Hobby: Picking their nose</li>

                </ul>
                <p>
                    Remy Smothers grew up in the small, forgotten town of Skuttlebut, Iowa, 
                    a place known for two things: an annual mud-pie festival and the world’s largest collection 
                    of vintage cowbells. Remy was no stranger to oddity. Their mother, Delilah Smothers, 
                    was a former circus performer who specialized in fire-eating, and their father, 
                    Ernie Smothers, was a man of few words but spent most of his time crafting dioramas out of 
                    roadkill in the basement. It was a household where the phrase "normal" didn't even exist.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Remy Smothers is a real son of a bitch. This person is a bizarre and rebellious character with a quirky but unsettling behavior.
                    This motherfucker once bought out all the red vines in 14 liquor stores in their hometown of Skuttlebut, Iowa. They also have a permanent red tint 
                    between their toes. Sick shit, right?

                    <li>Famous Sicko Trait: Kicking people in the balls</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Don't even get me started on this motherfucker. This dude is a menace to society. A true piece
                    of shit. Its been reported that he's kicked an average of 340 people in the balls each year since
                     he was 8 years old. He grew up in wealth and privilege, surrounded by the money. They said the atmosphere 
                    of his family's funeral business and taxidermy hobby really turned this fucker loose. Anywho, the first time he kicked someone int he balls, 
                    was at his 8th birthday after a magician trick went wrong. At that point he was hooked and turned that shit into his signature trait. From
                    terrorizing classmates, teachers, and even strangers, he never got in trouble. His wealthy parents always bailed him out,
                     leaving him free to continue his painful reign of low blows. Fucking dick...

                <ul class="bio-list">
                    <li>Pronouns: He/Him</li>
                    <li>Favorite Hobby: grows potatoes in his backyard</li>
                    <li>Famous Sicko Trait: Licking the handrails of the NY Subway</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Howard Woodson? Yeah, he's that piece of shit you’ve probably seen on the subway, the one licking the handrails on the trains. Sounds fucking nuts, right? But to him, it's totally normal. It all started as a dumb dare during his first visit to the city—- his buddy bet him to lick a handrail on the J train. Most people would cringe and move on, but not Howard's dumbass. For some reason, he loved that shit. Said it made him feel like he was tasting the heartbeat of New York City itself. (Probably would have been a poet in another life, huh?)</p>
                <p>Now, it’s basically his thing. He spends hours a day riding the subway, hopping from train to train, running his tongue over every handrail he can find like he’s collecting pieces of the city’s soul. People stare, they whisper, but Howard? He doesn’t care. To him, it’s more than just licking a gross piece of metal—it’s like he’s connecting with the city in a way no one else would ever understand. Strange? Sure. But in his mind, he's just as much a part of New York as the subway itself.</p>
